# AutoProx
Bash automation for Proxmox Node Creation

## Why?
Like you, I love proxmox. But who wants to build the same node 100 times? I don't. So I built this.

#### Why not use the web API?
Not everyone has open port access to their boxes in their environment. I don't. I have free roam SSH access though, and luckily the good people who built proxmox provided a CLI based tool that I can call via SSH.
